                    The crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject 
                    of considerable stylistic debate. The form varies among different 
                    types of writing. For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and 
                    fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement 
                    of paragraph breaks.
